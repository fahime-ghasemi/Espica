1
00:00:12,763 --> 00:00:14,184
I'm really glad to be here.

2
00:00:14,835 --> 00:00:16,523
I'm glad you're here,

3
00:00:16,547 --> 00:00:18,380
because that would be a little weird.

4
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:21,385
I'm glad we're all here.

5
00:00:22,123 --> 00:00:24,976
And by "here," I don't mean here.

6
00:00:26,651 --> 00:00:27,801
Or here.

7
00:00:28,548 --> 00:00:29,700
But here.

8
00:00:29,724 --> 00:00:30,874
I mean Earth.

9
00:00:31,447 --> 00:00:35,390
And by "we," I don't mean those of us in this auditorium,

10
00:00:35,414 --> 00:00:36,884
but life,

11
00:00:36,908 --> 00:00:38,357
all life on Earth --

12
00:00:38,381 --> 00:00:43,763
(Laughter)

13
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:46,091
from complex to single-celled,

14
00:00:46,115 --> 00:00:48,439
from mold to mushrooms

15
00:00:48,463 --> 00:00:49,841
to flying bears.

16
00:00:49,865 --> 00:00:51,231
(Laughter)

17
00:00:53,556 --> 00:00:55,065
The interesting thing is,

18
00:00:55,089 --> 00:00:58,120
Earth is the only place we know of that has life --

19
00:00:58,144 --> 00:01:00,021
8.7 million species.

20
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:01,734
We've looked other places,

21
00:01:01,758 --> 00:01:03,855
maybe not as hard as we should or we could,

22
00:01:03,879 --> 00:01:05,806
but we've looked and haven't found any;

23
00:01:05,830 --> 00:01:08,106
Earth is the only place we know of with life.

24
00:01:09,138 --> 00:01:10,412
Is Earth special?

25
00:01:11,411 --> 00:01:13,865
This is a question I've wanted to know the answer to

26
00:01:13,889 --> 00:01:15,143
since I was a small child,

27
00:01:15,167 --> 00:01:17,199
and I suspect 80 percent of this auditorium

28
00:01:17,223 --> 00:01:20,231
has thought the same thing and also wanted to know the answer.

29
00:01:20,699 --> 00:01:22,866
To understand whether there are any planets --

30
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:25,168
out there in our solar system or beyond --

31
00:01:25,192 --> 00:01:26,650
that can support life,

32
00:01:26,674 --> 00:01:29,871
the first step is to understand what life here requires.

33
00:01:30,395 --> 00:01:33,958
It turns out, of all of those 8.7 million species,

34
00:01:33,982 --> 00:01:36,180
life only needs three things.

35
00:01:36,852 --> 00:01:39,704
On one side, all life on Earth needs energy.

36
00:01:39,728 --> 00:01:43,213
Complex life like us derives our energy from the sun,

37
00:01:43,237 --> 00:01:45,338
but life deep underground can get its energy

38
00:01:45,362 --> 00:01:47,084
from things like chemical reactions.

39
00:01:47,108 --> 00:01:49,259
There are a number of different energy sources

40
00:01:49,283 --> 00:01:50,526
available on all planets.

41
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:52,376
On the other side,

42
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:55,105
all life needs food or nourishment.

43
00:01:55,561 --> 00:02:00,035
And this seems like a tall order, especially if you want a succulent tomato.

44
00:02:00,059 --> 00:02:01,775
(Laughter)

45
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:04,865
However, all life on Earth derives its nourishment

46
00:02:04,889 --> 00:02:06,919
from only six chemical elements,

47
00:02:06,943 --> 00:02:09,947
and these elements can be found on any planetary body

48
00:02:09,971 --> 00:02:11,307
in our solar system.

49
00:02:12,357 --> 00:02:15,584
So that leaves the thing in the middle as the tall pole,

50
00:02:15,608 --> 00:02:17,562
the thing that's hardest to achieve.

51
00:02:17,586 --> 00:02:19,478
Not moose, but water.

52
00:02:19,502 --> 00:02:22,283
(Laughter)

53
00:02:23,105 --> 00:02:24,899
Although moose would be pretty cool.

54
00:02:24,923 --> 00:02:26,081
(Laughter)

55
00:02:26,105 --> 00:02:31,640
And not frozen water, and not water in a gaseous state, but liquid water.

56
00:02:32,568 --> 00:02:35,021
This is what life needs to survive, all life.

57
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:38,836
And many solar system bodies don't have liquid water,

58
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:40,496
and so we don't look there.

59
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:43,513
Other solar system bodies might have abundant liquid water,

60
00:02:43,537 --> 00:02:44,872
even more than Earth,

61
00:02:44,896 --> 00:02:47,346
but it's trapped beneath an icy shell,

62
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:49,631
and so it's hard to access, it's hard to get to,

63
00:02:49,655 --> 00:02:52,374
it's hard to even find out if there's any life there.

64
00:02:53,295 --> 00:02:56,290
So that leaves a few bodies that we should think about.

65
00:02:56,314 --> 00:02:58,743
So let's make the problem simpler for ourselves.

66
00:02:58,767 --> 00:03:02,108
Let's think only about liquid water on the surface of a planet.

67
00:03:02,132 --> 00:03:05,088
There are only three bodies to think about in our solar system,

68
00:03:05,112 --> 00:03:07,694
with regard to liquid water on the surface of a planet,

69
00:03:07,718 --> 00:03:12,544
and in order of distance from the sun, it's: Venus, Earth and Mars.

70
00:03:13,085 --> 00:03:16,457
You want to have an atmosphere for water to be liquid.

71
00:03:16,481 --> 00:03:18,859
You have to be very careful with that atmosphere.

72
00:03:18,883 --> 00:03:22,295
You can't have too much atmosphere, too thick or too warm an atmosphere,

73
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:25,224
because then you end up too hot like Venus,

74
00:03:25,248 --> 00:03:26,985
and you can't have liquid water.

75
00:03:27,009 --> 00:03:30,962
But if you have too little atmosphere and it's too thin and too cold,

76
00:03:30,986 --> 00:03:33,010
you end up like Mars, too cold.

77
00:03:33,685 --> 00:03:36,160
So Venus is too hot, Mars is too cold,

78
00:03:36,184 --> 00:03:37,348
and Earth is just right.

79
00:03:37,372 --> 00:03:40,847
You can look at these images behind me and you can see automatically

80
00:03:40,871 --> 00:03:43,468
where life can survive in our solar system.

81
00:03:44,116 --> 00:03:45,716
It's a Goldilocks-type problem,

82
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:48,230
and it's so simple that a child could understand it.

83
00:03:49,272 --> 00:03:50,452
However,

84
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:54,198
I'd like to remind you of two things

85
00:03:54,222 --> 00:03:57,176
from the Goldilocks story that we may not think about so often

86
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,296
but that I think are really relevant here.

87
00:03:59,876 --> 00:04:01,026
Number one:

88
00:04:02,131 --> 00:04:04,923
if Mama Bear's bowl is too cold

89
00:04:05,653 --> 00:04:07,661
when Goldilocks walks into the room,

90
00:04:08,462 --> 00:04:10,605
does that mean it's always been too cold?

91
00:04:11,645 --> 00:04:14,913
Or could it have been just right at some other time?

92
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:19,151
When Goldilocks walks into the room determines the answer

93
00:04:19,175 --> 00:04:20,507
that we get in the story.

94
00:04:20,934 --> 00:04:22,664
And the same is true with planets.

95
00:04:22,688 --> 00:04:24,714
They're not static things. They change.

96
00:04:24,738 --> 00:04:26,480
They vary. They evolve.

97
00:04:26,504 --> 00:04:28,547
And atmospheres do the same.

98
00:04:28,571 --> 00:04:30,273
So let me give you an example.

99
00:04:30,297 --> 00:04:32,299
Here's one of my favorite pictures of Mars.

100
00:04:32,323 --> 00:04:35,454
It's not the highest resolution image, it's not the sexiest image,

101
00:04:35,478 --> 00:04:36,981
it's not the most recent image,

102
00:04:37,005 --> 00:04:40,499
but it's an image that shows riverbeds cut into the surface of the planet;

103
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:43,724
riverbeds carved by flowing, liquid water;

104
00:04:45,335 --> 00:04:50,221
riverbeds that take hundreds or thousands or tens of thousands of years to form.

105
00:04:50,245 --> 00:04:51,863
This can't happen on Mars today.

106
00:04:51,887 --> 00:04:54,368
The atmosphere of Mars today is too thin and too cold

107
00:04:54,392 --> 00:04:56,533
for water to be stable as a liquid.

108
00:04:56,557 --> 00:05:00,905
This one image tells you that the atmosphere of Mars changed,

109
00:05:00,929 --> 00:05:02,961
and it changed in big ways.

110
00:05:03,534 --> 00:05:08,343
And it changed from a state that we would define as habitable,

111
00:05:08,367 --> 00:05:11,957
because the three requirements for life were present long ago.

112
00:05:12,869 --> 00:05:14,937
Where did that atmosphere go

113
00:05:14,961 --> 00:05:17,781
that allowed water to be liquid at the surface?

114
00:05:17,805 --> 00:05:21,152
Well, one idea is it escaped away to space.

115
00:05:21,176 --> 00:05:23,843
Atmospheric particles got enough energy to break free

116
00:05:23,867 --> 00:05:25,520
from the gravity of the planet,

117
00:05:25,544 --> 00:05:28,233
escaping away to space, never to return.

118
00:05:28,257 --> 00:05:30,945
And this happens with all bodies with atmospheres.

119
00:05:30,969 --> 00:05:32,141
Comets have tails

120
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:35,422
that are incredibly visible reminders of atmospheric escape.

121
00:05:35,446 --> 00:05:38,855
But Venus also has an atmosphere that escapes with time,

122
00:05:38,879 --> 00:05:40,539
and Mars and Earth as well.

123
00:05:40,563 --> 00:05:43,531
It's just a matter of degree and a matter of scale.

124
00:05:43,912 --> 00:05:46,588
So we'd like to figure out how much escaped over time

125
00:05:46,612 --> 00:05:48,728
so we can explain this transition.

126
00:05:48,752 --> 00:05:51,363
How do atmospheres get their energy for escape?

127
00:05:51,387 --> 00:05:53,518
How do particles get enough energy to escape?

128
00:05:53,542 --> 00:05:56,727
There are two ways, if we're going to reduce things a little bit.

129
00:05:56,751 --> 00:05:57,902
Number one, sunlight.

130
00:05:57,926 --> 00:06:01,338
Light emitted from the sun can be absorbed by atmospheric particles

131
00:06:01,362 --> 00:06:03,076
and warm the particles.

132
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:05,208
Yes, I'm dancing, but they --

133
00:06:05,232 --> 00:06:06,703
(Laughter)

134
00:06:07,513 --> 00:06:09,425
Oh my God, not even at my wedding.

135
00:06:09,449 --> 00:06:10,941
(Laughter)

136
00:06:10,965 --> 00:06:13,968
They get enough energy to escape and break free

137
00:06:13,992 --> 00:06:16,492
from the gravity of the planet just by warming.

138
00:06:16,516 --> 00:06:19,678
A second way they can get energy is from the solar wind.

139
00:06:19,702 --> 00:06:24,728
These are particles, mass, material, spit out from the surface of the sun,

140
00:06:24,752 --> 00:06:27,156
and they go screaming through the solar system

141
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:28,965
at 400 kilometers per second,

142
00:06:28,989 --> 00:06:31,583
sometimes faster during solar storms,

143
00:06:31,607 --> 00:06:34,329
and they go hurtling through interplanetary space

144
00:06:34,353 --> 00:06:36,799
towards planets and their atmospheres,

145
00:06:36,823 --> 00:06:38,448
and they may provide energy

146
00:06:38,472 --> 00:06:40,600
for atmospheric particles to escape as well.

147
00:06:41,002 --> 00:06:42,971
This is something that I'm interested in,

148
00:06:42,995 --> 00:06:44,708
because it relates to habitability.

149
00:06:45,198 --> 00:06:48,330
I mentioned that there were two things about the Goldilocks story

150
00:06:48,354 --> 00:06:51,338
that I wanted to bring to your attention and remind you about,

151
00:06:51,362 --> 00:06:53,601
and the second one is a little bit more subtle.

152
00:06:53,625 --> 00:06:56,413
If Papa Bear's bowl is too hot,

153
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,234
and Mama Bear's bowl is too cold,

154
00:07:02,877 --> 00:07:05,988
shouldn't Baby Bear's bowl be even colder

155
00:07:06,901 --> 00:07:08,697
if we're following the trend?

156
00:07:10,015 --> 00:07:12,327
This thing that you've accepted your entire life,

157
00:07:12,351 --> 00:07:15,421
when you think about it a little bit more, may not be so simple.

158
00:07:16,333 --> 00:07:20,361
And of course, distance of a planet from the sun determines its temperature.

159
00:07:20,385 --> 00:07:22,651
This has to play into habitability.

160
00:07:22,675 --> 00:07:25,605
But maybe there are other things we should be thinking about.

161
00:07:25,629 --> 00:07:27,245
Maybe it's the bowls themselves

162
00:07:27,269 --> 00:07:30,325
that are also helping to determine the outcome in the story,

163
00:07:30,349 --> 00:07:31,649
what is just right.

164
00:07:32,585 --> 00:07:35,450
I could talk to you about a lot of different characteristics

165
00:07:35,474 --> 00:07:36,625
of these three planets

166
00:07:36,649 --> 00:07:38,218
that may influence habitability,

167
00:07:38,242 --> 00:07:40,836
but for selfish reasons related to my own research

168
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:44,448
and the fact that I'm standing up here holding the clicker and you're not --

169
00:07:44,472 --> 00:07:45,478
(Laughter)

170
00:07:45,502 --> 00:07:47,611
I would like to talk for just a minute or two

171
00:07:47,635 --> 00:07:48,932
about magnetic fields.

172
00:07:49,535 --> 00:07:52,067
Earth has one; Venus and Mars do not.

173
00:07:52,645 --> 00:07:55,768
Magnetic fields are generated in the deep interior of a planet

174
00:07:55,792 --> 00:07:59,509
by electrically conducting churning fluid material

175
00:07:59,533 --> 00:08:02,438
that creates this big old magnetic field that surrounds Earth.

176
00:08:02,462 --> 00:08:04,858
If you have a compass, you know which way north is.

177
00:08:04,882 --> 00:08:06,376
Venus and Mars don't have that.

178
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,314
If you have a compass on Venus and Mars,

179
00:08:08,338 --> 00:08:09,734
congratulations, you're lost.

180
00:08:09,758 --> 00:08:11,661
(Laughter)

181
00:08:11,685 --> 00:08:13,725
Does this influence habitability?

182
00:08:14,995 --> 00:08:16,297
Well, how might it?

183
00:08:16,844 --> 00:08:19,448
Many scientists think that a magnetic field of a planet

184
00:08:19,472 --> 00:08:21,867
serves as a shield for the atmosphere,

185
00:08:21,891 --> 00:08:25,246
deflecting solar wind particles around the planet

186
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:27,085
in a bit of a force field-type effect

187
00:08:27,109 --> 00:08:29,809
having to do with electric charge of those particles.

188
00:08:30,182 --> 00:08:33,809
I like to think of it instead as a salad bar sneeze guard for planets.

189
00:08:33,833 --> 00:08:36,112
(Laughter)

190
00:08:36,782 --> 00:08:40,163
And yes, my colleagues who watch this later will realize

191
00:08:40,187 --> 00:08:42,731
this is the first time in the history of our community

192
00:08:42,755 --> 00:08:45,034
that the solar wind has been equated with mucus.

193
00:08:45,058 --> 00:08:46,708
(Laughter)

194
00:08:48,798 --> 00:08:52,273
OK, so the effect, then, is that Earth may have been protected

195
00:08:52,297 --> 00:08:53,466
for billions of years,

196
00:08:53,490 --> 00:08:55,340
because we've had a magnetic field.

197
00:08:55,364 --> 00:08:57,543
Atmosphere hasn't been able to escape.

198
00:08:57,567 --> 00:08:59,674
Mars, on the other hand, has been unprotected

199
00:08:59,698 --> 00:09:01,540
because of its lack of magnetic field,

200
00:09:01,564 --> 00:09:03,516
and over billions of years,

201
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:05,720
maybe enough atmosphere has been stripped away

202
00:09:05,744 --> 00:09:08,337
to account for a transition from a habitable planet

203
00:09:08,361 --> 00:09:10,027
to the planet that we see today.

204
00:09:10,879 --> 00:09:13,868
Other scientists think that magnetic fields

205
00:09:13,892 --> 00:09:16,055
may act more like the sails on a ship,

206
00:09:16,778 --> 00:09:21,815
enabling the planet to interact with more energy from the solar wind

207
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:25,111
than the planet would have been able to interact with by itself.

208
00:09:25,135 --> 00:09:27,626
The sails may gather energy from the solar wind.

209
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:30,316
The magnetic field may gather energy from the solar wind

210
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:33,584
that allows even more atmospheric escape to happen.

211
00:09:33,608 --> 00:09:35,862
It's an idea that has to be tested,

212
00:09:35,886 --> 00:09:37,771
but the effect and how it works

213
00:09:37,795 --> 00:09:38,946
seems apparent.

214
00:09:38,970 --> 00:09:40,121
That's because we know

215
00:09:40,145 --> 00:09:43,220
energy from the solar wind is being deposited into our atmosphere

216
00:09:43,244 --> 00:09:44,395
here on Earth.

217
00:09:44,419 --> 00:09:46,824
That energy is conducted along magnetic field lines

218
00:09:46,848 --> 00:09:48,196
down into the polar regions,

219
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:50,356
resulting in incredibly beautiful aurora.

220
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:53,036
If you've ever experienced them, it's magnificent.

221
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:55,066
We know the energy is getting in.

222
00:09:55,090 --> 00:09:58,123
We're trying to measure how many particles are getting out

223
00:09:58,147 --> 00:10:01,185
and if the magnetic field is influencing this in any way.

224
00:10:02,542 --> 00:10:04,922
So I've posed a problem for you here,

225
00:10:04,946 --> 00:10:06,492
but I don't have a solution yet.

226
00:10:06,516 --> 00:10:07,792
We don't have a solution.

227
00:10:08,522 --> 00:10:10,879
But we're working on it. How are we working on it?

228
00:10:10,903 --> 00:10:13,201
Well, we've sent spacecraft to all three planets.

229
00:10:13,225 --> 00:10:14,701
Some of them are orbiting now,

230
00:10:14,725 --> 00:10:17,797
including the MAVEN spacecraft which is currently orbiting Mars,

231
00:10:17,821 --> 00:10:21,353
which I'm involved with and which is led here,

232
00:10:21,377 --> 00:10:23,186
out of the University of Colorado.

233
00:10:23,210 --> 00:10:25,492
It's designed to measure atmospheric escape.

234
00:10:25,842 --> 00:10:28,316
We have similar measurements from Venus and Earth.

235
00:10:28,773 --> 00:10:30,438
Once we have all our measurements,

236
00:10:30,462 --> 00:10:33,337
we can combine all these together, and we can understand

237
00:10:33,361 --> 00:10:36,778
how all three planets interact with their space environment,

238
00:10:36,802 --> 00:10:37,964
with the surroundings.

239
00:10:37,988 --> 00:10:41,510
And we can decide whether magnetic fields are important for habitability

240
00:10:41,534 --> 00:10:42,692
or not.

241
00:10:42,716 --> 00:10:44,981
Once we have that answer, why should you care?

242
00:10:45,005 --> 00:10:46,305
I mean, I care deeply ...

243
00:10:47,948 --> 00:10:49,954
And financially as well, but deeply.

244
00:10:49,978 --> 00:10:51,820
(Laughter)

245
00:10:52,583 --> 00:10:54,501
First of all, an answer to this question

246
00:10:54,525 --> 00:10:56,628
will teach us more about these three planets,

247
00:10:56,652 --> 00:10:57,812
Venus, Earth and Mars,

248
00:10:57,836 --> 00:11:00,747
not only about how they interact with their environment today,

249
00:11:00,771 --> 00:11:02,698
but how they were billions of years ago,

250
00:11:02,722 --> 00:11:04,784
whether they were habitable long ago or not.

251
00:11:04,808 --> 00:11:06,452
It will teach us about atmospheres

252
00:11:06,476 --> 00:11:08,471
that surround us and that are close.

253
00:11:08,947 --> 00:11:11,131
But moreover, what we learn from these planets

254
00:11:11,155 --> 00:11:13,176
can be applied to atmospheres everywhere,

255
00:11:14,305 --> 00:11:17,218
including planets that we're now observing around other stars.

256
00:11:17,242 --> 00:11:18,997
For example, the Kepler spacecraft,

257
00:11:19,021 --> 00:11:22,229
which is built and controlled here in Boulder,

258
00:11:22,253 --> 00:11:25,538
has been observing a postage stamp-sized region of the sky

259
00:11:25,562 --> 00:11:26,809
for a couple years now,

260
00:11:26,833 --> 00:11:29,061
and it's found thousands of planets --

261
00:11:29,085 --> 00:11:31,998
in one postage stamp-sized region of the sky

262
00:11:32,022 --> 00:11:36,111
that we don't think is any different from any other part of the sky.

263
00:11:36,635 --> 00:11:38,445
We've gone, in 20 years,

264
00:11:38,469 --> 00:11:42,506
from knowing of zero planets outside of our solar system,

265
00:11:42,530 --> 00:11:44,283
to now having so many,

266
00:11:44,307 --> 00:11:47,446
that we don't know which ones to investigate first.

267
00:11:49,089 --> 00:11:50,549
Any lever will help.

268
00:11:52,359 --> 00:11:55,943
In fact, based on observations that Kepler's taken

269
00:11:55,967 --> 00:11:58,096
and other similar observations,

270
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:59,289
we now believe that,

271
00:11:59,313 --> 00:12:04,012
of the 200 billion stars in the Milky Way galaxy alone,

272
00:12:04,606 --> 00:12:09,210
on average, every star has at least one planet.

273
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:12,142
In addition to that,

274
00:12:12,166 --> 00:12:17,867
estimates suggest there are somewhere between 40 billion and 100 billion

275
00:12:17,891 --> 00:12:21,223
of those planets that we would define as habitable

276
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:24,371
in just our galaxy.

277
00:12:26,410 --> 00:12:28,447
We have the observations of those planets,

278
00:12:28,471 --> 00:12:30,955
but we just don't know which ones are habitable yet.

279
00:12:30,979 --> 00:12:34,585
It's a little bit like being trapped on a red spot --

280
00:12:34,609 --> 00:12:35,780
(Laughter)

281
00:12:35,804 --> 00:12:37,036
on a stage

282
00:12:37,998 --> 00:12:41,560
and knowing that there are other worlds out there

283
00:12:42,862 --> 00:12:45,638
and desperately wanting to know more about them,

284
00:12:46,994 --> 00:12:50,928
wanting to interrogate them and find out if maybe just one or two of them

285
00:12:50,952 --> 00:12:52,562
are a little bit like you.

286
00:12:54,064 --> 00:12:56,623
You can't do that. You can't go there, not yet.

287
00:12:56,647 --> 00:13:00,640
And so you have to use the tools that you've developed around you

288
00:13:00,664 --> 00:13:01,959
for Venus, Earth and Mars,

289
00:13:01,983 --> 00:13:04,796
and you have to apply them to these other situations,

290
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:09,516
and hope that you're making reasonable inferences from the data,

291
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:12,658
and that you're going to be able to determine the best candidates

292
00:13:12,682 --> 00:13:15,081
for habitable planets, and those that are not.

293
00:13:15,959 --> 00:13:18,674
In the end, and for now, at least,

294
00:13:18,698 --> 00:13:21,485
this is our red spot, right here.

295
00:13:22,196 --> 00:13:25,532
This is the only planet that we know of that's habitable,

296
00:13:25,556 --> 00:13:28,747
although very soon we may come to know of more.

297
00:13:28,771 --> 00:13:31,507
But for now, this is the only habitable planet,

298
00:13:31,531 --> 00:13:32,833
and this is our red spot.

299
00:13:33,796 --> 00:13:35,216
I'm really glad we're here.

300
00:13:36,327 --> 00:13:37,502
Thanks.

301
00:13:37,526 --> 00:13:40,757
(Applause)
